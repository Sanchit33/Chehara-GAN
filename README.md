### Dataset

Dataset was generated using the below models. 

-[GPEN](https://github.com/yangxy/GPEN)

-[GFPGAN](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN)

-[FFHQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) can be used, but generating a dataset would help in dealing with real image problems.


### Implementation Details
- Model architecture: [fastai v1 u-net](https://fastai1.fast.ai/vision.models.unet.html)
- Paired image2image training: [fastai v1 superres notebook](https://github.com/aarcosg/fastai-course-v3-notes/blob/master/refactored_by_topics/CNN_L7_gan_feature-loss.md)
